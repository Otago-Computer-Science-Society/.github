# Contributing

So you want to contribute? That's great! There's heaps of ways to get involved, whether that's with fixing bugs, making new features, writing documentation or helping with community moderation. Hopefully this guide will be helpful on getting you started!

Read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

## Where do I begin? 

### "I have a contribution I want to make"

That's great! When contributing to an OCSS repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, Discord, or any other method with the owners of the repository before continuing. This gives everybody involved a good understanding on what the change is, and why it's being made. 

### "I want to help but I don't know how"

That's okay! A good place to start is by using the code and seeing if there's something you think could be better. Otherwise you can take a look at the open issues with this, or any of the OCSS repositories. Whether you're able to fix the issue, or provide insight to the current discussion, it will give you an idea of what kind problems the project is currently facing. 


## The Process

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem or want to add a feature, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant by filling out the issue template.

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our issues to find one that interests you. In some OCSS repositories you may be able to narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone, but if an issue is non-urgent and you want time to tackle it, it may be assigned to you. Otherwise if you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix. This process is project dependent, so ask the maintainers if you're unsure. 

### Make Changes

1. Fork the repository.
- Using the command line:
  - [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.
- Using GitHub Desktop:
  - [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
  - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!


2. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, a project member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged!

Congratulations :tada::tada: the OCSS Community thanks you :sparkles:.

Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible in the project.
